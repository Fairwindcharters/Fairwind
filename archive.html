Preparation for the charter was excellent with the boat clean and well presented. This boat is ease to manouvre under power as well as sail. The briefing notes and briefing at the wharf were both excellent.
</p><p>We followed the 14 day itinerary suggested in the notes and found the advice in it excellent - we could have spent twice as much time in each place had the charter been longer! We found the recommended anchorages accurately presented and excellent places to spend the night in peace and quiet. Great Barrier Island is a delight, Whangaroa Harbour/Rere bay a paradise and of course, Army Bay is hard to surpass.
