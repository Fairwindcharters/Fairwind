            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>BOOKING CONDITIONS:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Reservations:</strong> On making a booking you will be sent an invoice for the deposit and final payments. We require require a deposit payment of 30% of the charter total to be paid within 7 days to confirm your booking. The remainder of the charter payment is required 30 days prior to the charter start. For charters starting within 30 days of booking date, full payment is required to confirm your booking. A copy of the Charter Contract wording (see below) is sent to you at the time of booking.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Competency</strong>: At the time of booking you will be required to fill out a sailing resume. Your booking will be accepted (or declined) on the basis of this resume but, if at the time of charter, we consider that you lack the skills to safely handle the boat then we reserve the right to put a skipper on board at your expense. If a skipper is not available then you must wait for one at your cost. The onus is on you to be sure that you have the skills to do the job.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Note that we have never had to enforce above requirement to have a skipper.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Change of dates or boat:</strong> We are happy to change your booking dates or the type of boat you have chosen at any time, as long as this change does not affect the boat's booking schedule or ability to earn revenue. This means that you can't change your dates without penalty if that change would leave a gap between charters that we cannot then sell.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Cancellation by Fairwind:</strong> If we cancel your charter (for any reason) prior to the start date we will provide a full refund of any charter monies paid, but Fairwind is not liable for any other costs incurred by you.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Cancellation by the client:</strong> For cancellations made more than 90 days prior to the charter start Fairwind will refund your deposit less a $250 cancellation fee. For cancellations within 90 days of the charter start we will only give a refund if we can rebook the boat. We recommend you purchase suitable travel insurance to protect you in case you need to cancel your holiday.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Cancellation or curtailment due to weather:</strong> Fairwind reserves the right to cancel or curtail charter the if the conditions are such that it is dangerous to proceed, in which case a monetary refund will be made for the period lost. This cancellation with right to refund is at the sole discretion of Fairwind Charters. This type of cancellation is a rare occurrence, as the anchorages in this area offer safe havens in all but extreme weather.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Fairwind does not give refunds for cancellation by the charterer due to inclement weather (sorry) but we are happy to amend the charter dates prior to the charter start (if bookings allow) if you think the weather is better at another date. 
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>CHARTER CONDITIONS: </strong>
</p><p>Below is the wording of the contract which our charterers are required to sign prior to the commencement of the hire. It is intended to be simple to understand, but an explanation of the items in bold is at the bottom.

</p><p>

</p><p>FairWind reserves the right to recall the Vessel at any time during the Hire Term should FairWind (at its sole discretion) consider the weather conditions prevent safe navigation or endanger the safety of the Vessel or passengers.
</p><p>FairWind is not liable to the Charterer for any refund of charter fees or other costs, including travel expenses, should the Charterer cancel the Hire for any reason.
</p><p>

This excess is $5000 NZD unless you have elected to purchase the bond waiver insurance, in which case the bond is $500.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">2.4 Loss of dinghy: This means that if don't tie the dinghy up properly and it was to drift away then the insurance company would likely impose a higher excess (more than $500 but not more than $5000).&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">3.2: The charter limits for all our boats lie between Cape Karikari (60 miles north of Bay of Islands) and Cape Collville (south of Auckland) and up to 12 miles offshore.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">3.3: Night sailing is not permitted by law for bareboat charters.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">3.5 Hazardous Areas: We don't allow you to tie up to the busy commercial wharves at Paihia and Russell as they are not suited for yachts. We don't allow you to go up the Kerikeri River, as this is narrow, winding and tidal and requires local knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p></p></div>
